# ieee-bhatt-tda-demo
Supplementary material for "Embedded Tactical Decision Aid Framework for Environmentally Adaptive Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Communication and Navigation". This demo requires MATLAB&reg;.

There is code to automatically save the figures that has been disabled. It requires the [export_fig](https://github.com/altmany/export_fig) package. If you would like to save any figures, uncomment the body of the helper function `h_printPNG()`.

If you have any questions, please reach out to me. I am more than happy to run the TDAs on my end and screen share.
